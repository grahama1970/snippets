# Snippets Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the Snippets repository! This repository contains a collection of reusable code templates designed to streamline and enhance your development workflow. These snippets are specifically crafted for integration with the Cursor.sh application, allowing developers to quickly and efficiently insert commonly used code structures and patterns directly into their projects.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to provide developers with a set of high-quality, standardized code snippets that can be easily accessed and inserted into their projects. By using these snippets, developers can:

- **Speed up Development:** Quickly insert pre-built code templates to reduce manual coding and boilerplate code.
- **Ensure Consistency:** Maintain consistent coding practices across different projects by using standardized templates.
- **Reduce Errors:** Utilize well-tested and optimized snippets to minimize the potential for coding errors.

## Integration with Cursor.sh

This repository is fully integrated with the Cursor.sh application. By embedding these snippets as documentation within Cursor, developers can effortlessly access and insert them into their codebase using the `@` parameter within the Cursor IDE.

### How to Use

1. **Access Snippets:** Within the Cursor IDE, simply type the `@` parameter followed by the name of the snippet you wish to use. A list of available snippets will appear for you to choose from.

2. **Insert Snippets:** Once you’ve selected a snippet, it will be automatically inserted into your code at the cursor's position. You can then customize the snippet as needed for your specific use case.

3. **Search Snippets:** You can also search for specific snippets using keywords, allowing you to quickly find and insert the exact template you need.

### Migrating from VSCode

If you're migrating from VSCode to Cursor.sh, you’ll find that many of the features you're familiar with are supported, with additional enhancements tailored for efficient coding. Key points to consider during migration include:

- **Familiar Shortcuts:** Cursor.sh supports many of the same keyboard shortcuts as VSCode, making it easy to adapt. You can find a complete list of shortcuts and commands in the Cursor documentation [here](https://docs.cursor.com/get-started/migrate-from-vscode#keyboard-shortcuts).
  
- **Snippets and Code Completion:** Just as in VSCode, you can access code snippets and take advantage of code completion features in Cursor.sh. The `@` parameter in Cursor.sh functions similarly to the snippet triggers in VSCode, allowing for quick access to predefined code templates.

- **Workspace Setup:** Cursor.sh allows you to import your VSCode settings and workspace configurations. If you are setting up your workspace for the first time in Cursor.sh, refer to the [workspace setup guide](https://docs.cursor.com/get-started/migrate-from-vscode#workspace-setup) to make the transition seamless.

## Snippets Included

This repository currently includes the following snippets:

1. **Lazy-Loaded Class Template:** A Python class template with lazy-loaded dependencies, logging, and Pydantic validation. This template is ideal for creating modular, scalable, and maintainable code structures that avoid circular imports.

2. **Lazy-Loaded Class Test Suite Template:** A comprehensive test suite for the Lazy-Loaded Class template. It covers initialization, dependency injection, logging, error handling, and validation to ensure the class works as intended.

## Contributing
